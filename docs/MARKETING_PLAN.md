# pinnr Landing Page Marketing Plan

## Overview

**Domain:** pinnr.app
**Product:** A travel-focused place list app built to replace Google Maps' clunky list system
**Target Audience:** Curious travelers who want local, off-the-beaten-path experiences—not tourist traps
**Tone:** Confident, minimal, slightly playful. Think: "for people who actually care about where they eat"

---

## Page Structure

### 1. Hero Section

**Headline Options (pick one):**
- "Your places. Actually organised."
- "Ditch the Google Maps chaos"
- "Travel lists that don't suck"
- "Find the locals' spots. Skip the tourist traps."

**Subheadline:**
> Save, organise, and share the places that matter. Built for travelers who do their homework.

**Elements:**
- Logo (top left)
- App Store + Play Store badges (prominent CTAs)
- Single hero image: phone mockup showing the app interface
  - *Placeholder: use a styled card/frame with "App screenshot coming soon" or a minimal wireframe illustration*

---

### 2. Problem Section (The Hook)

Keep this punchy. One short paragraph or 3-4 bullet points.

**Header:** "Google Maps lists are broken"

**Copy:**
> You've saved 47 places across 6 cities. Good luck finding them.
>
> - New saves buried at the bottom
> - Sharing is a nightmare
> - No way to mark "visited" or "skip"
> - Switching between lists? Pain.

*This section validates the user's frustration. They've felt this. You're naming it.*

---

### 3. Solution Section (What pinnr Does)

**Header:** "Lists that actually work"

3-4 feature blocks, each with:
- Icon (simple, monoline style)
- Short title (2-4 words)
- One-liner description

**Features:**

| Feature | Title | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Map-first | Explore visually | See all your saves on a map. Tap any pin to view details or get directions. |
| Lists | Smart organisation | Create lists by city, trip, or vibe. Drag to reorder. Mark as visited. Add notes. |
| Sharing | Collaborate live | Share a list link with viewer or editor access. Changes sync in realtime. |
| Quick save | No friction | Save places instantly. Search, tap, done. Add notes and tags later. |

**Visual:**
- 3 phone mockups showing different screens (list view, map view, sharing)
- *Placeholder: styled cards with dotted borders and "Screenshot" labels*

---

### 4. How It Works (Optional, keep minimal)

If you want to add context for skeptical users:

**3 steps:**
1. **Search** — Find any place with autocomplete. Tap to see details.
2. **Save** — Add to a list with one tap. Drag to reorder. Mark visited.
3. **Share** — Send a link. Collaborate in realtime.

*Visual: simple numbered flow or horizontal step cards*

---

### 5. Social Proof Section

**Header:** "Made for travelers, by travelers"

Since you're early, you can:
- Add a short quote from yourself or your brother (real users!)
- Show a placeholder testimonial card: "More reviews coming soon"
- Later: add real testimonials with name + photo

**Example testimonial:**
> "We used to spend hours prepping lists before trips. Now it takes 10 minutes."
> — *Adam, co-founder*

---

### 6. Final CTA Section

**Header:** "Ready to ditch the chaos?"

**Subhead:** "Download pinnr and start your next trip organised."

- App Store badge
- Play Store badge

---

### 7. Footer

Minimal:
- Logo
- Links: Privacy Policy | Terms | Contact
- Social icons (if applicable): Instagram, Twitter/X
- Copyright: © 2026 pinnr

## SEO Strategy

### Key SEO Elements

1. **H1:** Use the main headline (e.g., "Your places. Actually organised.")
2. **Alt text for images:** Descriptive (e.g., "pinnr app showing a list of saved restaurants in Tokyo")
3. **Structured data:** Add LocalBusiness or SoftwareApplication schema
4. **Open Graph tags:** For link previews when shared
   - og:title: "pinnr — Travel lists that actually work"

   - og:image: Social share image (1200x630px)
5. **Canonical URL:** https://pinnr.app

## GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)

GEO is about making your site friendly for AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.).

### Recommendations

1. **Clear, structured content**
   - Use headers (H1, H2, H3) logically
   - Write in complete sentences that answer implied questions
   - Example: "pinnr is a mobile app for iOS and Android that helps travelers save and organise places they want to visit."

2. **FAQ section (add to page or as separate /faq)**
   ```
   Q: What is pinnr?
   A: pinnr is a free app that lets you save, organise, and share lists of places—like restaurants, cafes, and attractions—while traveling.

   Q: Is pinnr free?
   A: Yes, pinnr is free to download and use. Premium features may be added in the future.

   Q: How is pinnr different from Google Maps?
   A: Google Maps lists are hard to navigate, sort, and share. pinnr gives you drag-and-drop ordering, visited markers, and one-tap sharing.

   Q: Can I share my lists with friends?
   A: Yes! Generate an invite link with viewer or editor permissions. Collaborators see changes in realtime.

   Q: Do I need to create an account?
   A: No. Start using pinnr instantly—no signup required. You can create an account later to sync across devices.
   ```

3. **Entity clarity**
   - Mention "pinnr" consistently (not "the app" or "it")
   - State explicitly: "pinnr is available on the App Store and Google Play"

4. **Conversational phrasing**
   - AI engines often pull answers from natural language
   - Good: "pinnr helps travelers find local spots by letting them create and share place lists."
   - Avoid: Dense marketing jargon

## Questions to Answer Before Building

1. **Do you have App Store / Play Store links yet?** If not, use placeholder buttons that scroll to an email signup or just don't link anywhere yet.

2. ~~**Privacy Policy / Terms pages?** You'll need these for app store submissions. Can be simple for now.~~ ✅ Done — GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy and Terms of Service added.

3. **Analytics preference?** I'd suggest Plausible (privacy-friendly, simple) over Google Analytics.

4. **Contact method?** Email address? Contact form? Just an email link is fine for MVP.

---

## Summary

Keep it tight:
- Hero (headline + download buttons)
- Problem (why Google Maps fails)
- Solution (what pinnr does, 3-4 features)
- CTA (download again)
- Footer

No fluff. No endless scrolling. One clear message: **pinnr makes travel lists work.**

When you have screenshots, drop them in. Until then, styled placeholder cards maintain the layout without looking broken.
