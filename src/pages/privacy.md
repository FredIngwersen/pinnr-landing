## Data Storage and Security

Your data is stored securely using industry-standard practices. We use encryption in transit and at rest to protect your information.

## International Data Transfers

pinnr is operated from Denmark within the European Union. Your data is primarily stored within the EU. Where we use service providers that may process data outside the EU (such as cloud infrastructure providers), we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, including Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission.
